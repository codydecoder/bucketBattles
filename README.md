# bucketBattles
Tired of listening to terrible analysts and washed-up 6th men explain basketball? Now's your chance to join bucket battles and see how your picks stack up against the "experts".

## Vision
I intend to create a website that allows users to choose who they think will win basketball games and if they are correct they gain experience and form, and if they are not correct they lose form but still gain experience.
